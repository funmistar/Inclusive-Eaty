# InclusiveEaty
A Project by Alexandra Simon-Lewis, Khushboo Verma, Reema Sodha and Funmi Falegan

The concept for this project came about as a result of the 2020 Code First Girls Diversity Hackathon. The goal was to design a website or app that championed diversity of thought. The aim was to eliminate bias and promote diversity. After careful consideration, we developed an idea that utilises a gap in the market in the hospitality industry. 

People are diverse, their needs varied. In a group of friends, family or work colleagues, everyone will have different personal needs when dining out to eat, which could lead to unhappiness, uncertainty or isolation. But we all deserve joy and safety. At present, the restaurant and bar scene in London is exclusionary to various minority groups - those withh disabilities, dietary and religious restrictions and accessibility needs. Customers are being left out and businesses are missing opportunities.

That's why we created Inclusive Eaty - a website restaurant finder that is dedicated to championing diversity and inclusivity in this field. With our wide array of filters, we have created a welcoming platform through which users can search for restaurants based on allergies, alcohol preference, religious restrictions, accessibility needs and dietary preference (to name but a few). 

With a brand design that is distinctive and joyous, we offer a highly competitive and attractive platform with a USP that creates real social change. It caters to a large and growing demographic, with  global scalability. We offer a new revenue stream for businesses on our platform, as well as a sense of security and belonging for our customers.
